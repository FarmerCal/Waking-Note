Waking Note is a simple app with the goal of mimicking the best parts of my current "to do" notebook and adding additional features to make the process more simple and efficient.

- the type of light emmitted by the app will be similar to a kindle, low, book-level light
- the routine of designing each day as its own will be preserved


Waking note will allow you to ...
- create your own categories for items so that future planning is easier
- preserve persistant items for future days lists
- "star" special items to remember and find them more easily
- save pictures from special events alongside the completed item
- back up the lists to the cloud to allow you to look back on special events
